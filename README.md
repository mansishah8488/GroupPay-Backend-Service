GrouPay

• Created an application based on Android in which users were able to create, join a group and start multiple events for example, Saturday Night party!

• This application basically provided a correct splitting of money for the group for events to take place.

• A paying frequency was determined by the admin, and every user was notified for the minimum payment.

• A Node.js Server was deployed on EC2 for providing a collaborative back-end real-time service.

• Material UI was implemented for clean user interface.
